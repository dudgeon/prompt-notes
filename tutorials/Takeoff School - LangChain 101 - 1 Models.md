### Intro
Framework/library for building AI-interacting apps.

Six core modules:
- Models: SupReplit Node.JS for Prompt Energy:
sk-Sfzdrq9m04mmqD7dS6rCT3BlbkFJU3ySbxrNtLjvA2HIyXRkported model types and integrations.
- Prompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.
- Memory: Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.
- Indexes: Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.
- Chains: Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).
- Agents: An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.
- Callbacks: Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.
