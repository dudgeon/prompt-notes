Six core modules:
-   [Models](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models.html): Supported model types and integrations.
-   [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html): Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.
-   [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html): Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.
-   [Indexes](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes.html): Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.
-   [Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html): Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).
-   [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html): An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.
-   [Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.
